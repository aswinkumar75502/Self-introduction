    <h1>Self Introduction</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is <b>Ranjith Kumar P</b>, and I’m currently pursuing my <b>B.E. in Cyber Security</b> at <b>SRM Valliammai Engineering College</b>. I’ve always been fascinated by the world of technology, networks, and how information moves securely across the internet. My curiosity about <b>ethical hacking</b>, <b>digital forensics</b>, and <b>system protection</b> motivated me to choose this field as my career path.</p>

    <h2>Current Focus</h2>
    <p>As a beginner in the cyber security domain, I’m currently exploring fundamental concepts such as <b>network security</b>, <b>Linux systems</b>, <b>cryptography</b>, and programming languages like <b>Python</b> and <b>C</b>. I’m also learning about the importance of <b>cyber ethics</b> and the responsibility that comes with securing digital systems. In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with cybersecurity tools, reading about data breaches, and staying updated with the latest trends in information security.</p>

    <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
    <p>I have a strong interest in <b>ethical hacking</b>, <b>penetration testing</b>, and <b>vulnerability assessment</b>. I’m developing my technical skills by participating in online courses, Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, and open-source projects. Apart from tech, I also value teamwork, communication, and problem-solving — qualities that I believe are essential for a successful cybersecurity professional.</p>

    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p>My ultimate goal is to become a <b>Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)</b> and work with organizations to protect their systems from cyber threats. In the coming years, I aim to gain practical experience through internships, security workshops, and research projects. I also plan to contribute to the global cyber community by spreading awareness about online safety and privacy.</p>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>I believe that the future belongs to those who can secure it. As technology continues to evolve, so do cyber threats — and I want to be on the front line of defending digital spaces. My dream is to combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to make the internet a safer place for everyone.</p>
